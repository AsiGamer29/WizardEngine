We are students from CITM at UPC, and we created this engine for an assignment at our university.

## Engine characteristics ##
### Description ###
In this Game Engine, you can create Game Objects, add a 3D model to them, a texture and a material, and you can move it around, rotate it, and scale it.

### Dynamic Camera ###
We have also aded a dynamic camera that you can move at will pressing right click and moving with your WASD keys. Pressing shift also makes you move the camera faster.

You can also orbit around the mouse pressing the alt key and clicking your left mouse key and dragging your mouse around.

### User Interface ###
The user interface is quite simmilar to other Game Engines, in that you can select your file, open/close pop-up windows, and also click the Help button to go to our documentation, bug reports, or simply know who we are and who made this engine.

By interacting with the UI, you can create GameObjects using different shapes, such as spheres, pyramids, cubes, and more!

Selecting GameObjects in the Hierarchy window lets you modify values such as texture, position, rotation and scale.
